# Balancer Bi-Weekly Update 01-12-2023

## Recap of the Previous Two Weeks


**ARB Received Last Disbursement:** 342,858 (KYC delays resulted in collecting 2 biweekly payments at the start of the program, details in change section below)

**ARB Utilized as Incentives in the Last Two Weeks: [171,429](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x062eac303ad41cb62bac8dd7acd69d092c5050a2804bd1ac980efe75b4644a91)

**Contracts incentivized over the last 2 weeks:** A CSV of incentived along with details about $ARB flows to each one and how they were calculated can be found [here](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/data_automation/blob/main/notebooks/arb_dao_grant_distribution/output/dao_grant_2023-11-02_2023-11-16.csv).
These amounts of payment were queued and the required 171,429 $ARB sent for payment by this [multisig transaction](https://app.onchainden.com/safes/arb1:0xb6BfF54589f269E248f99D5956f1fDD5b014D50e/transactions/0xb5c2d7db571bce5c5fcd41ad5a02ca5d91f7f3e4ae5ca46cc4d1c81ea784ab06?nid=200179) executed at 16:14 UTC on Friday November 17th.
These payments will be streamed to stakers in the gauge by the injector and the gauge system for 2 weeks, ending today on December 1st.

**ARB left over:** 171,429

**Plan for leftover ARB:** Increase biweekly amount distrbuted to ___ for the remaining periods. Somehow this brings us close to the weekly amounts we had proposed in our original STIP proposal before reducing amounts.

**Summary of incentives:** [Insert Summary]

**Additional Info / Disclosures to Multisig:** [Insert additional info]
Tags for each contract address can be found in the csv above, we would be happy to export them in some other format.   The additions here are automamtic and dyanmic based on governance and voting, so it would be nice if we could find a way to automate the address labeling process and/or bulk upload a larger addressbook in a defined format.
