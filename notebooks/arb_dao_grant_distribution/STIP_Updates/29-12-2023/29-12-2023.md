# Balancer Bi-Weekly Update 29-12-2023
![img_1.png](img_1.png)
## Recap of the Previous Two Weeks


**ARB Received Last Disbursement:** 342,858 (KYC delays resulted in collecting 2 biweekly payments at the start of the program, details in change section below)

**ARB Utilized as Incentives in the Last Two Weeks: [171,429](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x24488fd95589c8f78077c517862011b1a1531d2ccb6e8b49367d1cf11aeacd7f)

**Contracts incentivized over the last 2 weeks:** A CSV of incentived along with details about $ARB flows to each one and how they were calculated can be found [here](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/data_automation/blob/main/notebooks/arb_dao_grant_distribution/output/dao_grant_2023-11-16_2023-11-30.csv).
These amounts of payment were queued and the required 171,429 $ARB sent for payment by this [multisig transaction](https://app.onchainden.com/safes/arb1:0xb6BfF54589f269E248f99D5956f1fDD5b014D50e/transactions/0x7e550b33e7fd3efe670263fab17448f20a68e8e5054dafb48b5b885c2012faf1) executed at 20:43 UTC on Friday December 15th.
These payments will be streamed to stakers in the gauge by the injector and the gauge system for 2 weeks, ending today on December 15th.

**ARB left over:** 137,143.2

**Plan for leftover ARB:** Two rounds ago, the decision was made to increase biweekly amount distrbuted to 205,714.8 for the remaining periods. The higher incentive amount coupled with favorable market conditions have led to a large increase in productive TVL on Balancer which will be outlined in detail in the summary section. The plan for Balancer is the same as it has been from the start, continue to target liquid staking derivatives for Ethereum and create a sticky liquidity cycle on the Arbitrum network. 

Expanding on this point, Balancer continues to expand the diversity on Arbitrum with new yield bearing assets each round. Ethereum LSTs will cotninue to expand as the core pool flywheel is amplified by ARB, and plsRDNT has began to take off on Balancer as the hub for permalocked Radiant dlp. The next yield bearing asset to keep an eye out for is sFRAX, a stablecoin which will quietly begin to take over the market on Balancer with yield for our set and forget LPs to be able to count on as a capital efficient core pool. 

**Summary of incentives:** Incentives were dispersed based on the CSV above, which shows where the ARB was sent based upon the plan outlined in [Balancer's FINAL STIP Round 1 framework](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/balancer-final-stip-round-1/16689). As mentioned in the prior report, there was a correction made to the dynamic boost which pushes a larger share of incentives towards the higher performing pools in terms of fees earned. This, like the Balancer core pool models is one of the layers of optimization engineering our team works on day in and day out. This round has seen a much more efficient direction of incentives, and we can see the results begin to take affect. Our team is excited to see this adjustment continue to unfold on the network. 

Looking back at where we were on December 15th, there have been healthy developments throughout the pools which were top earners last round. The Aura ecosystem has been instrumental in bringing partners like Plutus and Radiant up to speed quickly and efficiently, and we expect them to continue to do so as sFRAX comes further into the picture. To maintain the same comparison from last round we will look at the same pools; with some additional ones joining the center stage. The [RDNT/WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x32df62dc3aed2cd6224193052ce665dc181658410002000000000000000003bd) pool increased from 60MM to 74MM TVL and the average volume is mainting for now, this week at 1.15MM from 1.19 MM per day last round. Looking at the same liquid staking derivative pools from last round [cbETH/rETH/wstETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x4a2f6ae7f3e5d715689530873ec35593dc28951b000000000000000000000481), [WETH/rETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xade4a71bb62bec25154cfc7e6ff49a513b491e81000000000000000000000497), [wstETH/WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x9791d590788598535278552eecd4b211bfc790cb000000000000000000000498) and [ankrETH/wstETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x3fd4954a851ead144c2ff72b1f5a38ea5976bd54000000000000000000000480) have reached all time highs, with no exceptions. Our newest LST pool [sfrxETH/wstETH/rETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x0c8972437a38b389ec83d1e666b69b8a4fcf8bfd00000000000000000000049e) is not only at it's all time high, but has already reached 1MM in TVL. We expect these pools to continue to grow and facilitate large amounts of volume throughout the Arbitrum network. 

The total ETH LST TVL is over 47.5MM at this point, for reference the previous round was 37.15MM (stable pools plus weighted portions) and volume for the two week period in the 5 mentioned stable LST pools is roughly 38.6MM while last round was 34.75MM. We expect these pools to continuously grow, and the fee on their yield bearing portion makes them extremely strong footholds for the DAO and LPs to thrive together in building. 

The pools dedicated to routing liquidity on Balancer supported by the ARB STIP are the 4POOL and the 4POOL/wstETH pair. The [4POOL](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x423a1323c871abc9d89eb06855bf5347048fc4a5000000000000000000000496) pool has has increased another 5% at time of writing in TVL to 5.15MM in the two week span and is averaging 1.9MM compared to previously 2.2MM in volume per day. The [4POOL/wstETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xa1a8bf131571a2139feb79401aa4a2e9482df6270002000000000000000004b4) pool is at it's all time high, just under 1.2MM in TVL. The volume over a two week period is holding steady at 500k for both this period and 500k for the previous. 

[Savy](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-482-enable-savvy-tricrypto-svusd-sveth-svbtc-pool-gauge-arbitrum-with-2-emission-cap/5321/4), [ANKR](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-493-enable-ankr-ankreth-gauge-arbitrum/5363/3) , and[Plutus](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-497-enable-plsrdntv2-8020rdntweth-gauge-with-a-2-weight-cap/5377/3) were all mentioned last round as pools to keep an eye out for. The Savy and ANKR pools have yet to take part in the incentives cycle, and TVL respectively are at 128k and 18k. We will report further on these if they do begin to receive ARB.

The Plutus plsRDNT pool has begun to climb the charts though, as incentives from Radiant and Plutus have gone live via Aura. The pool will receive its first round of Balancer STIP incentives in the upcoming round.

**Mechanism for distribution incentives:** Distributions will be done every week via Balancer DAO's [ARB injector contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xF23d8342881eDECcED51EA694AC21C2B68440929#readContract) by sending direct incentives to the gauges of the respective pools in the Balancer ecosystem.

**Summary of incentives plan:** Incentives will be heading to the pools mentioned above over the next two week period. The pools Balancer expects to be highlights of the next report are the ones mentioned above, and these new pools joining the Arbitrum ecosystem. The [plsRDNT](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x451b0afd69ace11ec0ac339033d54d2543b088a80000000000000000000004d5) pool which will be kickstarted increasing in magnitude over time as it scales up. This will have second order affects permanently locking RDNT/WETH tokens on the platform. The new LST pool to bring more yield bearing liquidity to the ecosystem is the [sfrxETH tripool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x0c8972437a38b389ec83d1e666b69b8a4fcf8bfd00000000000000000000049e). While TVL is negligent currently, Balancer has placed a bribe to get incentives started and begin bootstrapping another LST juggernaught.   

**Summary of changes to the original plan:** As stated above, biweekly distributions were increased from 171429 to 205714.2 $ARB in order to pay out the full amount before February 15th as requested. Aside from the increase in incentive density, the plan will be carried out as planned, with additional gauges as they approved by Balancer governance.
